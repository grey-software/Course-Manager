# User Journey

## **Early Prototype**

## Entering the Website

I enter the website, and I am presented with a screen that has a settings button on the top-left, a 'USER' text, the website's name and logo right beside it and a card with dotted border and a plus sign at its center below. On the right edge of the screen, I see an empty to-do list on top of an empty sticky-notes section that is on top of an empty calendar.

## Adding a Course

When I click on the dotted card with the plus sign, I am directed to a new page that will represent a course. There is a Home/Back button on the top of the screen which when clicked, will redirect me back to the homepage. There is also an 'edit' button and a 'delete' button.

In this page, I have the options to edit the course code, course name, course lecture times, and assessments (along with its weighting and deadlines). Every lecture time and assessments deadlines gets automatically added to the calendar and the latter also gets added to-do list.

There is also a button that will allow me to edit the card that corresponds to the course in the homepage. When the button is clicked, I can set the card's background image, etc.

## Settings Button (Discord settings as inspiration)

I click on the settings button, and I am presented with a navbar on the left side of the screen with the options: 'My Account', 'Grade Settings', 'Home Layout', and 'Course Layout'. The right side of the screen corresponds to the item selected on the navbar.

When I click on 'My Account', I see the options to edit my name, username, and password.

When I click on 'Grade Settings', I see the options to edit my GPA Scale, and 'Pass or No Pass' Option.

When I click on 'Home Layout', I see the options to change my home layout.

When I click on 'Course Layout', I see the options to change my course layout.
